# Project2
This project aims to analyze the purchase behavior of credit card holders and identify market segments based on their spending patterns. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, which contains information about the credit card transactions of 18,000 customers across six different product categories. The project leverages various data mining techniques, including clustering and association rule mining, to uncover patterns and insights in the data. By segmenting the market, this project aims to help credit card companies tailor their marketing strategies to different customer groups, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. The results of this project provide valuable insights into customer behavior and can be applied to various industries beyond credit card companies.
